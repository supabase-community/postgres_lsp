# Linting Migrations

Postgres Language Tools comes with a `check` command that can be integrated into your development workflow to catch problematic schema changes and encourage best practices.

To run it, simply point at your migrations directory.

```sh
pglt check supabase/migrations
```

When you are setting it up in an existing project, you might want to ignore all migrations that are already applied. To do so, add `migrationsDir` and `after` to your `pglt.json` file


```json
{
    "migrations": {
        "migrationsDir": "supabase/migrations",
        "after": 1740868021
    }
}
```

Alternatively, pass them directly.

```
pglt check supabase/migrations --migrations-dir="supabase/migrations" --after=1740868021
```

This will only check migrations after the specified timestamp.

For pre-commit hooks and when working locally, use `--staged` to only lint files that have been staged. In CI environments, you most likely want to use `--changed` to only lint files that have been changed compared to your `vcs.default_branch` configuration. If `default_branch` is not set in your `pglt.json`, use `--since=REF` to specify the base branch to compare against.
